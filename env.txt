Virtual Environments

The main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.

1. To install virtual environment, type 

$ pip install virtualenv

2. Create a new virtual environment inside the directory

python3 -m venv env

2. To start virtual environment, type

$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $

3. To exit virtual environment, type
(env) $ deactivate
$
